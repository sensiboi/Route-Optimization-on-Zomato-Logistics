# Route-Optimization-on-Zomato-Logistics
This project analyzes the logistics efficiency of Zomato’s delivery operations using real-world data.

It explores how analytics capability factors—such as delivery ratings, vehicle condition, and multiple deliveries—affect delivery performance.

The study integrates a regression-based efficiency model and a route optimization simulation for dark store operations.

Results indicate weak linear relationships (R² ≈ 0), suggesting the need for nonlinear models and richer predictors like traffic and weather.

The project demonstrates how data-driven analytics can bridge the capability gap in modern logistics management.
